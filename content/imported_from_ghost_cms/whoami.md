Hi there! My name is **Robert C. Raducioiu** and I'm currently working as a Cyber-security consultant in Europe (Italy).

I spend part of my free time studying topics like:

- Malware Analysis
- Exploit Development
- Binary Exploitation
- Active Directory Exploitation

But I'm also interested in other subjects, like scripting, programming, and automation of all sorts of operations. Sometimes, I participate in `Capture The Flag `events, mainly on HackTheBox.

Work aside, I'm interested in music and art: I usually listen to `classical music` from video-game soundtracks and contemporary authors. I also like reading books, e.g. crime novels, fantasy novels.
